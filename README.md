# Climate change forecasting using Deep Learning #

Here our project main intention is to help the cities which are effected by the global warming. Global warming and climate change refer to an increase in average global temperatures. Natural events and human activities are believed to be main contributors to such increases in average global temperatures. Climate change, caused by rising emissions of carbon dioxide from vehicles, factories and power stations, will not only affect the atmosphere and the sea but also will alter the geology of the Earth. Emissions of carbon dioxide due to our use of fossil energy will change the climate and the temperature is estimated to increase by 2 to 6o Celsius within the year 2100, which is a tremendous increase from our current average temperature of 1.7o Celsius as predicted by IPCC. This may cause huge changes to our civilization, both positive and negative, but the total impact on our society is currently very uncertain. Forecasts indicate that major storms could devastate New York City in the next decade whereas Gulf countries will get affected badly well before.

We have kept the code using LSTM model and also we have posted the PPT , report and our abstract of the project in the Repo. 
We used jupyter to run our codes .
